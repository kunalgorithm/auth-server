# auth-server
An HTTP server with authentication built with NodeJS, MongoDB, Passport, and Express. The server provides endpoints for signing in with username and password, logging with in JSON web tokens using PassportJS's local authentication provider, and allows CRUD apoerations using the RESTful interface.
 
Makes for a solid boilerplate for a Node backend.

# Usage 

Clone the repository and install npm dependencies. 
```
git clone https://github.com/kunalgorithm/auth-server.git
cd auth-server
npm install 
```

Now, you can run the development server with 
`npm run dev`
or the production server with 
`npm run start`
